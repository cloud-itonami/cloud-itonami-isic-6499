# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Register the operator's (fund manager's) license/exemption status,
   jurisdiction and responsible principals.
2. Import historical LP subscriptions, portfolio-company investments and
   counterparties.
3. Run read-only validation of existing records against this blueprint's
   contracts.
4. Configure the InvestmentCommitteeGovernor's hold/escalation policy.
5. Publish a dry-run operation and audit export.

## Minimum Production Controls

- spec-basis citation required before any DD determination
- committing fund capital, or distributing exit proceeds, always requires
  Investment Committee (human) sign-off
- audit export for every hold, approval and disbursement
- backup manual process for governor/system outage

## Certification

Certified operators must prove LP/portfolio-record integrity, governor
independence, evidence-backed reporting and human review for every
high-stakes action (capital commitment, exit distribution).
